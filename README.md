# python-text-analysis
Python Text Analysis for Data Visualizations Final Project

The project was to utilize Python to do a word frequency analysis on a series of text documents over 5 time periods.  I chose to use the CEO letters from Berskshire Hathaway.  I picked the years, 1977, 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2015.

#### Input
1. BH-1977.txt
2. BH-1987.txt
3. BH-1997.txt
4. BH-2007.txt
5. BH-2015.txt

#### Processing
1. words.py _Retrieves the above files and outputs the comma seperated values files._
2. helper.py _Processes the files, removes stop words, creates dictionary of words/frequencies and sorts them._

#### Output
* BH-WordList.csv

#### Installations
Extract the files into the same directory and run in your favorite console.
